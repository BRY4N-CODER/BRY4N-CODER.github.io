			<div class="col-12 part fade-in">
				<p>I sail to an island into the unknown. For who knows what truths may behold!</p>
				<p>The winds thrust and trow as I begin to row.</p>
				<p>The night's gleam of stars in the sky as they be my guide</p>
				<p>to a place of unknown danger and seed.</p>
				<p>I wait as the wind blows me closer drinking all my mead.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-12 part fade-in">
				<p>Curiosity arouses me at once with many desires and wants.</p>
				<p>I hear the most unusual sound in the night that drains all my power and might.</p>
				<p>Tired and weary I feel as it seems like fate's seal.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-12 part fade-in">
				<p>A beauty on the shore as lust takes hold of me once more.</p>
				<p>Could this be the island core?</p>
				<p>The siren on the shore I begin to yearn for.</p>
				<p>The majestic, seductive sound of her voice leaves me with no choice.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-12 part fade-in">
				<p>On the shore I lay with little hope of life I take out my knife.</p>
				<p>My hands feel weary and feet sore as I lift my body from the island's shore.</p>
				<p>The siren grasps me and holds me tight</p>
				<p>as I begin to lose my sight with no sense of right and draining might.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-12 part fade-in">
				<p>Just then as if heaven's gift, my sword begins to lift!</p>
				<p>The sword glows as the winter's snow as a ghost takes it and woes!</p>
				<p>The ghost with great fury and rage sticks the knife in the siren's rib cage,</p>
				<p>and the heart revealed! I shall deal the death blow and the final seal!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-12 part fade-in">
				<p>I strike with what strength restored as the siren screamed and roared!</p>
				<p>The siren in agony screamed a final scream,</p>
				<p>and I awake to find it was all just a dream.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-12 part fade-in">
				<p>I lay in my bed awake and in awe of the dream</p>
				<p>which I shall title "The Siren Night" as I held a claw!</p>
				<p>Was this dream something I actually lived and saw?</p>
